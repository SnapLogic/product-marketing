### Pipeline Extensions

With Flows, business users can automate business processes without help from IT. There are always complex integration tasks for which they will need IT's help. The Pipeline Extension feature of Flows allows a business user to read from a pipeline and then trigger downstream activities in SnapLogic Flows. This feature also enables a business user to write the output of a Flow to a pipeline so that IT experts can process data in a pipeline or connect to a system such as a database or data warehouse that is under the IT domain.

### New endpoints

With this release, we have added the following endpoints to SnapLogic Flows:&#x20;

* Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales
* Microsoft Teams
* Microsoft Sharepoint
* ServiceNow
* SnapLogic Read/Write to Pipeline

### Unified Error Handling and more

November release for Flows now provides unified error handling in the 'Information Panel' on the right of the build screen. This consistent handling of messages and simplified errors for business users results in much more efficient troubleshooting. &#x20;
