### Webhook support for Salesforce and HubSpot

Business users can build real-time flows with webhook support for Salesforce and HubSpot. These webhooks can track changes in an object such as Account or Opportunity in Salesforce or Lead in HubSpot and can be used to trigger a flow which can update another system and notify a Customer Success Manager or a Sales Representative who is serving that account.

### New Endpoints

With this release we are adding two new endpoints to Flows

* HubSpot
* JIRA

### Auto Data Type Conversion

SnapLogic Flows now leverages AI to suggest data type for all incoming data fields. And with a single click, you can automatically convert data from 'String' to an appropriate data type before pushing it to the target endpoint. You have an option to override these suggestions so that you are always in control.

### Other new Features

* Flows is now an asset type just like a Pipeline
* You can configure Salesforce Account with OAuth Authentication

### Pipeline Extensions

With Flows, business users can automate business processes without help from IT. There are always complex integration tasks for which they will need IT's help. The Pipeline Extension feature of Flows allows a business user to read from a pipeline and then trigger downstream activities in SnapLogic Flows. This feature also enables a business user to write the output of a Flow to a pipeline so that IT experts can process data in a pipeline or connect to a system such as a database or data warehouse that is under the IT domain.

### New endpoints

With this release, we have added the following endpoints to SnapLogic Flows:&#x20;

* Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales
* Microsoft Teams
* Microsoft Sharepoint
* ServiceNow
* SnapLogic Read/Write to Pipeline

### Unified Error Handling and more

November release for Flows now provides unified error handling in the 'Information Panel' on the right of the build screen. This consistent handling of messages and simplified errors for business users results in much more efficient troubleshooting. &#x20;
